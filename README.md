## Introduction

"I Love YouTubeâœ¨" is a personal webpage created by me to express my passion for YouTube. The webpage features the following components:

1. **YouTube Channel Link**: A prominent link to a YouTube channel, encouraging visitors to explore and subscribe.

2. **Personal Message**: A heartfelt message expressing love for YouTube and its diverse community of creators.

3. **Profile Picture**: A profile picture of the YouTube channel.

4. **Subscription Button**: An interactive button that allows visitors to input their name and age. Depending on their age, a personalised message is displayed to either welcome them as a subscriber or inform them that they are not old enough to subscribe.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file with embedded CSS styles and JavaScript for interactivity. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:
